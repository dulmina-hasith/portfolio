# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Static GitHub Pages Edition

[![See Portfolio](https://img.shields.io/badge/See_Portfolio-LIVE-81b64c?style=for-the-badge&logo=googlechrome&logoColor=white)](https://dulmina-hasith.github.io/portfolio/)

Welcome to the static, serverless edition of my professional cybersecurity portfolio. This project was migrated from a Spring Boot + Thymeleaf web application to a fully client-side rendered, highly performant static application optimized for deployment on GitHub Pages.

Designed for recruiters, hiring managers, and security professionals, this portfolio showcases my technical skills, offensive and defensive projects, academic publications, and certifications.

##  Key Features

* **Serverless Architecture**: 100% static HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Runs directly in any modern browser without an application server or database.
* **CORS-Safe Dynamic Loading**: Fetches portfolio data dynamically from standalone JSON stores (`projects.json`, `skills.json`, etc.). Implements a robust local fallback mechanism so it works offline and directly via the `file://` protocol.
* **Recruiter-Centric UX**: Features client-side search, filtering (featured vs. all projects), and alphabetical sorting.
* **Formspree Contact Integration**: Completely serverless contact form with advanced spam validation (Akismet/hCaptcha).
* **SEO Optimized**: Implements unique meta tags for every page, Open Graph properties, Twitter cards, a dynamic success URL flow, and Google Structured Data (JSON-LD).
* **High Performance**: Achieves Lighthouse scores > 95 across all pillars (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO) due to zero layout shifts, zero heavy frameworks, and deferred/lazy resource loading.

## Running the Project Locally

Because the portfolio uses `fetch()` to load JSON data under production conditions, it is best viewed via a local web server to satisfy CORS policies.

### Option A: Using Visual Studio Code Live Server (Recommended)
1. Open the `portfolio` directory in VS Code.
2. Click **Go Live** in the status bar (requires the "Live Server" extension).
3. The browser will open the portfolio at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`.

### Option B: Using Node.js (npx)
Open a terminal in the root directory and run:
```bash
npx serve portfolio
```

### Option C: Direct file double-click (Offline Fallback)
You can double-click `index.html` to open the site directly using the `file://` protocol. The application will detect the environment, log a warning, and fall back to local static copies of the data, maintaining 100% functionality!
